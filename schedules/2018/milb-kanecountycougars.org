Cougars vs. Timber Rattlers Hey Jimmy is the premier party dance band in Chicagoland. The band covers mostly modern music and will play from 4 45-6 00 pm in the Acres Music Garden. Your game ticket is all you need to enter when gates open at 4 30 pm!



After Cougars games, fans can walk around to the center field gate and travel the warning track to run the bases. If the starting location for Run the Bases changes, it will be announced at the conclusion of the game. The occurrence of Run the Bases is subject to weather and field conditions. 

Stick around after the game for a fireworks show! This date's scheduled show is set to Classic Rock. Fireworks are subject to change, weather, and the Kane County-imposed curfew.

Snag a Cougars 2019 magnetic schedule for your fridge! The first 1500 fans through the gates will receive one, courtesy of Wintrust Bank.
