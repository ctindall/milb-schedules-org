Rainiers vs. River Cats Baseball, beer, and buddies. The three Bs are all embraced with open arms here at Cheney Stadium. Every Thursday night, Tacoma's party people gather on the top terrace of the left field party decks and enjoy $2 Coors Light 12oz cans and rotating food specials all night long. It's the most dependable good time to ever call a Thursday night home, and it's happening all season long at R House.

Rainiers vs. River Cats Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.

Rainiers vs. River Cats Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

This year, we're turning back the clocks to a simpler time when the Tacoma Giants. and Tacoma Twins called R House home. The Giants were the team that started it all, welcoming PCL baseball to Tacoma from 1960-65 while hosting future Hall of Famers Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry. The group delivered R City our first PCL Championship in 1961. The Twins graced the grounds of Cheney Stadium from 1972-77, boasting slugging infielder Rick Renick and ace southpaw Eddie Bane among their ranks. Special jerseys worn on field this weekend by the players and coaches will be auctioned off during the game, with proceeds benefiting Metro Parks Tacoma and Puyallup Cal Ripken.

Rainiers vs. 51s Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.

Rainiers vs. Aces Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.

Rainiers vs. Aces While our utmost respect for the men and women of our armed forces is always proudly on display all season long, once a year we get the opportunity to really go above and beyond in making them feel special. On Salute to Armed Forces Day, the entirety of Cheney Stadium, from top to bottom, will be dedicated to honoring those who bravely serve our nation and keep us safe. Specialty jerseys proudly worn by our players and coaches will be auctioned off during the game, with proceeds benefiting USO Northwest.

We've got the bases loaded, and the best hitting deal in baseball is at the plate ready to clear them. Six times this summer, swing by Cheney Stadium and scoop up a returning favorite, the Chick-fil-A Bring the Herd ticket package. At the ridiculously low price of just $44 you will receive 4 Reserved Seat tickets to a Sunday Rainiers game, 4 Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich meals, 4 Group Express meals at the stadium, and 4 exclusive hats. Swing away, Rainiers fans. You and the family have the green light to live large.

Rainiers vs. Grizzlies Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.

Rainiers vs. Bees Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.

Rainiers vs. Bees The Tacoma Rainiers are proud to once again partner with the Carol Milgard Breast Center to host Pink at the Park, an annual day at the ballpark aimed at raising funds to subsidize mammogram screenings for medically underserved women in the South Sound region. Specialty jerseys worn on field and signed by the Rainiers players and coaches will be auctioned off through a live auction following the game, as well as through an online auction. Proceeds will directly benefit CMBC.

We've got the bases loaded, and the best hitting deal in baseball is at the plate ready to clear them. Six times this summer, swing by Cheney Stadium and scoop up a returning favorite, the Chick-fil-A Bring the Herd ticket package. At the ridiculously low price of just $44 you will receive 4 Reserved Seat tickets to a Sunday Rainiers game, 4 Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich meals, 4 Group Express meals at the stadium, and 4 exclusive hats. Swing away, Rainiers fans. You and the family have the green light to live large.

Rainiers vs. Dodgers Look up! Our Friday Night Fireworks shows are back, and we like to think this year they are going to be better than ever. Come one, come all, and keep your eyes on the left field horizon, as we light the sky ablaze to carefully crafted mixes of the best tunes from now and then.

Purple is a majestic color, most often reserved for Earth's royalty and, of course, the University of Washington. For one special night, we're draping the friendly confines of Cheney Stadium in the shade of the Huskies. All game-worn specialty jerseys will be auctioned off during the game with proceeds benefiting UW Tacoma Scholarships. Bow down!

Rainiers vs. Sky Sox Back by popular demand, it's our pleasure to announce that Silver Bullet Saturdays are here for another go around the sun. For just $20 you get a ticket to the game in the exclusive R Yard at Coors Light Landing, early entry to watch batting practice, a limited-edition collectible t-shirt with a new design every month, and your first 12oz Coors Light when you walk in. Yes, you read that right. A ticket, t-shirt, and your first beer for just $20. That's much more exciting than half a tank of gas, isn't it?

The Tacoma Rainiers and Little Caesars Pizza have done it again, and with a deal this good, why mess with the recipe? Just like in years past, only $44 scores you 4 Reserved Seat tickets, 4 hats, 4 Group Express meals, 2 Hot-N-Ready pizzas, 2 orders of Crazy Bread, 2 free youth/tot admissions to Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium or Northwest Wildlife Park, and 2 free youth passes to the Museum of Glass. Not only is it a mouthful, it's also the most delicious deal in Tacoma Rainiers History.
