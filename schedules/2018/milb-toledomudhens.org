Mud Hens vs. Tides Get ready for a gnarly time at 80s Night! The Friday, June 8 Mud Hens game will feature all of the most righteous songs, TV shows, and movie clips from the most radical decade of all! Dig out those parachute pants, jean jackets, and load up on the hairspray because it will totally be a tubular time!

It wouldn't be 80s Night without an homage to former Toledo outfielder, Kirby Puckett! Kirby joined the Hens in 1984 before going on to be a 10x All-Star, 6x Gold Glove Winner, 6x Silver Slugger Award Winner, 2x World Series Champion, and 1991 ALCS MVP. The first 2,000 fans will receive their bobblehead on entrance.

We invite fans to stay in their seats after the game for the tremendous Toledo Mud Hens postgame fireworks display!

The party isn't over when the game ends, join us for Hensville Live every Friday and Saturday night with bonus holiday dates throughout the season! Local and regional bands will be featured in Hensville Park following the game free of charge.

SUMMARY:Mud Hens vs. IronPigs
DESCRIPTION:The Future Mud Hen Adult & Child Baseball Camp is a chance for children and adults to learn baseball and teaching skills from Mud Hens coaches and players. In turn, we hope the adults will continue to practice those same skills with the children when they go home. Adults should bring their baseball mitt so they can join in on the drills and lessons! The Adult & Child Baseball Camp is open to children ages 5 through 14 along with a parent, grandparent, brother, sister, or any other adult, 18 or older, who would like to accompany them. The Adult & Child Baseball Camp registration is $80 for one adult and one child and $40 for each additional camper. All campers who participate in the Adult & Child Baseball Camp will receive a Future Mud Hen Skills Camp t-shirt, a souvenir baseball for autographs, and a Mud Hens game ticket for the camper and adult for the July 21 game. Additional tickets can be purchased for $12.\n\nThe Toledo Mud Hens vs. Lehigh Valley IronPigs Eggs & Bacon rivalry resumes on Saturday, July 21. The Toledo Mud Hens will wear special edition egg-themed jerseys and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs will dawn their nationally recognized bacon themed jerseys.\n\nWe invite fans to stay in their seats after the game for the tremendous Toledo Mud Hens postgame fireworks display!\n\nThe party isn't over when the game ends, join us for Hensville Live every Friday and Saturday night with bonus holiday dates throughout the season! Local and regional bands will be featured in Hensville Park following the game free of charge.\n\nFollow on MiLB First Pitch: https://stza.co/+u_G7-1L\n\nShop: https://stza.co/+u_G7-z\n\nSynced via Stanza - create your own live updating calendar (https://stanza.co?events)\n\nFor questions, check out Stanza’s FAQs page: https://stanza.co/faqs
